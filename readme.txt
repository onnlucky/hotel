TODO
env should be mutable until closed ...
temp[] should be worker global, since they are handled atomically
remove OSETENV and OGETTEMP and such

implement some form of map structure or "just" map.c
add objects again; use type to switch from object/map
use *parent as prototype notation (self-alike)
implement splay: return(a1, a2, *list) by return.call(a1 :: a2 :: list)
